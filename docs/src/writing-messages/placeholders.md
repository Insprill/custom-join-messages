# Placeholders

CJM supports [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/6245/)
placeholders in all messages. Along with this, it also has some of its
own placeholders built-in. Those are as follows:

- **%displayname%**: The display name of the player.
- **%name%**: The name of the player.
- **%prefix%**: The players prefix, if
  [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34315/) is installed.
- **%suffix%**: The players suffix, if
  [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34315/) is installed.
- **%uniquejoins%**: The amount of unique players who've joined the
  server.
- **%uuid%**: The UUID of the player. Mainly used when inserting a
  link to a player profile.
