Colours
=======

Messages can have colours inserted in multiple ways.

MiniMessage
-----------

The newer `MiniMessage <https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/index.html>`_ format is supported, however, only on `Paper <https://papermc.io/>`_ 1.16+ servers.
MiniMessage adds support for more advanced colouring in a more human-readable format. It also enables support for clickable and hoverable chat message.
For more information on the MiniMessage format, you can visit `its wiki <https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/format.html>`_
Note that when using MiniMessage, you *cannot* use legacy formatting.

Legacy
------

Legacy `colour codes <https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php>`_ can be inserted as in most plugins, in one of two ways:

* **&<code>**
* **ยง<code>**

HEX
~~~
Hex colours can be inserted one of four ways:

* **#000000**
* **&#000000**
* **<#000000>**
* **{#000000}**

**MiniMessage is highly recommended over legacy and HEX codes.**
