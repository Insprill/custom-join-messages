Formatting
==========

Messages can have colours inserted in multiple ways.

MineDown
--------

CJM uses `MineDown <https://github.com/Phoenix616/MineDown>`_ to format messages.
MineDown is very similar to MarkDown (hence it's name) and makes colouring messages and clickable and hoverable messages very simple to write.
For more information on the syntax, you can checkout their `syntax guide<https://github.com/Phoenix616/MineDown#syntax>`_.
