Placeholders
============

CJM supports PlaceholderAPI_ placeholders in all messages.
Along with this, it also has some of its own placeholders built-in. Those are as follows:

* **%displayname%**: The display name of the player.
* **%name%**: The name of the player.
* **%prefix%**: The players prefix, if Vault_ is installed.
* **%suffix%**: The players suffix, if Vault_ is installed.
* **%uniquejoins%**: The amount of unique players who've joined the server.
* **%uuid%**: The UUID of the player. Mainly used when inserting a link to a player profile.
* **%world_from%**: The name of the world a player is traveling from. Only works when world-based messages are enabled.
* **%world_to%**: The name of the world a player is traveling to. Only works when world-based messages are enabled.
