<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Custom Join Messages can way more than just add Custom Join Messages. 
You can send titles, action bar messages, private messages, have custom quit messages, and much more! 
Including having different messages for different groups, have it pick a random message from a list, and even have it only send messages within a range of the person who joined/ left! 
You can toggle join/ quit messages per player (with MySQL support). It has full support for PlaceholderAPI, SuperVanish/ PremiumVanish (& most other vanish plugins), 
Vault prefixes/ suffixes, and AuthMe! It also has a few extra features like being able to check the first join date of online & offline players!
